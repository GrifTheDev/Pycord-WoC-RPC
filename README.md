# Pycord-WoC-RPC
Pycord and World of Coding RPC, thought I would just release this one on my profile rather then WoC org.

*Install Nord.Js
*Run npm i discord-rpc (In Terminal)
*Run Node . (In Terminal)

If you want to try and update the application (Different picture etc...) you will have to make a new application within the discord dev portal
